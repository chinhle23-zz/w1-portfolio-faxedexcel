                    I'm currently a student at Momentum Learning in Durham, NC immersively training to become a professional web developer. I have 15 years of mortgage industry experience with jobs in Sales, Operations and most recently in Capital Markets. My most recent role as Pricing Manager, for which I've held for 8 years, has given me ample experience in evaluating, advising, implementing, configuring, and managing loan origination software meant to improve efficiency & clarity, meet regulatory requirements, and streamline the overall residential home financing process. I'm looking to leverage my experience in mortgages with my skills in web development to revolutionize the industry to where applying for a home loan would be as easy as applying for a credit card.
